# Previews and sketches:
then there would be images of some chapters here using css to flip through them like pages
with brief captions explaining what's happening:

# Development cycle:
I have a list here of how the development cycle of this webcomic has gone and what I plan to do in the future
- **drafting ideas**
  - think of anything at all. here is where you can get crazy and start thinking of funny stuff, tragic stuff, etc
- **writing ideas in a doc**
  - organize your ideas in a doc and think of ways they could work in the story. try writing snippets of scenes or how you'd like certain things to feel
- **first draft**
  - put all your ideas in here and go crazy writing stuff, anything goes as long as you keep it moving.
- **draft more ideas and fix things**
  - fix plot holes and other stuff here, and then begin to write in even more ideas you have here. it could be a change of perspective or maybe you have an even better idea of what to write.
- **second draft**
  - same as last time, go crazy off the walls writing whatever and stay in the moment.
- **finalize**
  - fix everything and if necessary, go back to drafting again
- **write the spanish version**
  - this is where you localize jokes, give the version a unique voice, and try to fix any pairety issues that may come up.
- **create character sheets**
  - before drawing each chapter, make a character sheet to familiarize yourself with it's characters. doing this prevents having to create last minute designs.
- **draft  crude drawings for panels**
  - as tempting as it is to draw the final version right away, time needs to be spent testing different panelling poses and tempo. these dont have to look good, it only serves to give you an idea of how everything should flow.
- **rearrange panels** 
  - this may be the hardest part to do emotionally, but you need to rearrange panels if you want the tempo to feel right sometimes.
- **begin drafting panels**
  - once everything is finished, start drawing some real sketches for each panel
- **finalize**
  - this is where you ink everything in and make it look pretty.
- **draw cover**
  - make a cover to hype your readers up. color it in, try a new artsyle but make it interesting
- **publish**
  - after all that work its finally time to publish part 1 of your story.

- **do it all over again**
  - repeat the process for all remaining parts of the series...
